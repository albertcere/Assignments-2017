# Lab 2: Doors in the Cloud


# Tasks to do:


## Python Development Environment
### Task 2.1:  Installing Anaconda
 Download and installing Anaconda in your labtop following hands-on 4 ([Python Development Environment Quick Start](Phyton-Development-Environment-Quick-Start.md)) guidelines.
 
### Task 2.2: Your first notebook
Start an iPython notebook on your terminal and create a note book that contains your previous [`Lab1.guessnumber.py`](https://github.com/jorditorresBCN/Assignments-2017/blob/master/Lab01.md) code including some explanation of your steps using `markdown` cells. Save your notebook as `Lab2.guessnumber.pynb` and add it to your remote github repository.

### Task 2.3: Getting Started with NLTK
Tokenisation is one of the most basic, yet most important, steps in text analysis required in the following task. The purpose of tokenisation is to split a stream of text into smaller units called tokens, usually words or phrases. For this purpouse we will use the [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org) Python Natural Language Processing Toolkit. 

This task consist of understand different steps required for a word count of the book [First Contact with TensorFlow](http://www.jorditorres.org/Tensorflow). The notebook `WordCountWithNLTK.ipynb`  contains both code and text elements that describe the main steps. Run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by pressing `shift` + `enter` that will help to you understand in detail the [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org) package.




### Task 1.10:  
Be sure that you have updated your remote github repository with all the Lab files. Submit **before the deadline** to the RACO a "Lab2.txt" file including: 

1. Group number
2. name and email of the members of this group
3. github url that contains your lab answers (the same as Lab1)
4. indicate if you did or not the optional task and why 
5. add any comment that you consider necessary.


### Task 1.11:  
Start an iPython notebook on your terminal and create a note book that contains your previous word count code including some explanation of your steps using `markdown` cells. 
### Task 1.12:  
Include this file in your local repository on your labtop with the name `Lab1.WordCount.pynb`.
### Task 1.13:  
Update your remote github repository with the updated `README.md`and the two new files `Lab1.AWSterminal.png` and `Lab1.WordCount.pynb` using the `git`commands `add`, `commit` and `push`. 
### Task 1.14: (optional)
What are Stop Words? When working with text mining applications, we often hear of the term â€œStop Word Removal". Create a new version of your program that remove the stop words in our example file with the name `Lab1.WordCountStopWordsRemoved.pynb` and update your remote github repository with this new file
