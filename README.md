# Practical assignments

There will be two kinds of assignments: 5 Labs and one project. Pre-lab homework will be assigned for some labs. Students are expected to complete and submit the assigned pre-lab homework before each lab session.

## Labs
The students will begin by creating a basic toolbox to get started in the Cloud. This will prepare them to practice with APIs, the doors in the Cloud. Together, these things will allow the students to mine the deluge of data coming from the Cloud, or use new advanced analytics services provided nowadays by the Cloud. Finally, we will look under the hood of these advanced analytics services in the Cloud, either in terms of software or hardware, in order to understand how their high performance requirements can be provided. The purpose is
to provide code examples that can get you started easily.

- Lab 1: [Basic "Knowledge Toolbox" to getting started in the Cloud][Lab1] **10%**
- Lab 2: [Doors in the Cloud][Lab2]                                        **20%**
- Lab 3: [Extracting and Analyzing data from the Cloud][Lab3]              **20%**
- Lab 4: [Interacting with users and services in the Cloud][Lab4]          **20%** + **5% (optional part)**
- Lab 5: [Under the hood of Cloud Advanced Analytics Services][Lab5]       **20%** + **5% (optional part)**

## Course Project
The project can be done in pairs and need to be approved by your teacher before starting (from the student's proposal for the project).

**Four levels:** 
* **Minimum (max  grade 60%)**: One possibility of project is to prepare a presentation of some related technologies with this part of the course (with slides).
* **Medium (max grade 90%)**: Another alternative to the project may be to create a self-contained practical guide (hands-on) that guides the reader in learning one of the latest cloud technologies.
* **Full**:  The standard project is to create an application using existing APIs. For example:  
  * Colorize photos using Deep Learning  with Algorithmia API
  * Building a ChatBot with Watson API
  * News Aggregator based on Sentiment with Aylien API

* **Advanced (bonus of +10%)**  The project offers an excellent opportunity for the student to dive into course content by implementing a protoype (proof of concept implementation of a business idea created by the student) using the latest Cloud technology. Your teacher will be deligted to help you


## Deadlines
### Deadlines for Labs
The deadlines indicated are suggestions for when you should ideally finish each Hands-on. They are meant to help keep you on track so that you maintain an appropriate pace throughout the program. There are penalties if you miss these deadlines. It is a recommended best practice to try and meet each suggested deadline.
### Deadline for course Project
We have a hard deadline for the project to be finished acording the course planification.
