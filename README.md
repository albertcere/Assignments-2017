# Practical assignments

There will be two kinds of assignments: Labs and one project.

## Labs
The students will begin creating a basic toolbox to get started in the Cloud. This will prepare them to practice with APIs, the doors in the Cloud. All these things together will allow the students to mine the deluge of data coming from the Cloud, or use new advanced analytics services provided nowadays by the Cloud. Finally, we will look under the hood of these advanced analytics services in the Cloud, either in terms of software or hardware, in order to understand how their high performance requirements can be provided. 

- Lab 1: [Basic "Knowledge Toolbox" to getting started in the Cloud][Lab1]
- Lab 2: [Doors in the Cloud][Lab2]
- Lab 3: [Analyzing the Cloud][Lab3]
- Lab 4: [Advanced Analytics as Cloud Services][Lab4]
- Lab 5: [Under the hood of Cloud Advanced Analytics Services][Lab5]

## Course Project
The project offers an excellent opportunity for the student to dive into course content by implementing a protoype (proof of concept implementation of a business idea created by the student) using the latest in the Cloud technology. 

An alternative to the project may be to create a self-contained practical guide (hands-on) that guides the reader in learning one of the latest cloud technologies. 

The project will be individual and will be agreed with the teacher before to start it (from the student's proposals for his project).
