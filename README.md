# Practical assignments

There will be two kinds of assignments: Labs and one project. Pre-lab homeworks will be assigned for some labs. Students are expected to complete and submit the pre-lab homeworks assigned before each lab session.

## Labs
The students will begin creating a basic toolbox to get started in the Cloud. This will prepare them to practice with APIs, the doors in the Cloud. All these things together will allow the students to mine the deluge of data coming from the Cloud, or use new advanced analytics services provided nowadays by the Cloud. Finally, we will look under the hood of these advanced analytics services in the Cloud, either in terms of software or hardware, in order to understand how their high performance requirements can be provided. The purpose is
to provide code examples that can get you easily started.

- Lab 1: [Basic "Knowledge Toolbox" to getting started in the Cloud][Lab1] **10%**
- Lab 2: [Doors in the Cloud][Lab2]                                        **20%**
- Lab 3: [Extracting and Analyzing data from the Cloud][Lab3]              **20%**
- Lab 4: [Interacting with users and services in the Cloud][Lab4]          **20%** + **5% (optional part)**
- Lab 5: [Under the hood of Cloud Advanced Analytics Services][Lab5]       **20%** + **5% (optional part)**

## Course Project
The project will be individual (or in pairs) and needs to be agreed with the teacher before to start it. 

**Three levels:** 
* **Minimum (max  grade 60%)**: Prepare a presentation of some of related technologies presented along this part of the course (slides)
* **Medium (max grade 90%)**: An alternative to the project may be to create a self-contained practical guide (hands-on) that guides the reader in learning one of the latest cloud analytics technologies. 
* **Full**:  Create an applications using existing APIs. [Starting here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/02/6-deep-learning-applications-beginner-python/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AnalyticsVidhya+%28Analytics+Vidhya%29)
  * Colorize photos using Deep Learning  with Algorithmia API
  * Building a ChatBot with Watson API
  * News Aggregator based on Sentiment with Aylien API

* **Advanced (bonus of +5%)** Using GitHub API create a realtime REST service of Deep Learning metrix [as this example] (https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/830499993450450944) ([example of other uses](http://www.timqian.com/star-history/#imatge-upc/detection-2016-nipsws&jorditorresBCN/LibroTensorFlow)

* **Advanced (bonus of +10%)** The project offers an excellent opportunity for the student to dive into course content by implementing a protoype (proof of concept implementation of a business idea created by the student) using the latest in the Cloud technology.
