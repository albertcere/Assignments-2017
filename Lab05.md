# Lab 5: Under the Hood of Cloud Advanced Analytics Services

GPU cloud computing is available on-demand on all major cloud platforms.It is the computational engine for the new era of AI.  Last month Google Cloud Platform launch a public beta allowing users to deploy NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs. Also [Amazon did the same](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/) some months ago. 

The new Google Cloud GPUs are tightly integrated with Google [Cloud Machine Learning](https://cloud.google.com/ml/) (Cloud ML), which aims to slash the time it takes to train machine learning models at scale using the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) framework.

In this lab we will review the main characteristics of  [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), one of the most popular frameworks to build AI models and see how can be executed in a powerful GPU architecture.
