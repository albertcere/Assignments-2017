# Lab 5: Under the Hood of Cloud Advanced Analytics Services

In previous lab we suggested an "optional" task that uses the [Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) from Google to detect text within images as an example of Advanced Analytics as a Service in the Cloud. The platform to support this type of services require high performance computing resources as GPU accelerators and a powerful software, as TensorFlow, one of the current computational engine for the new era of AI. 

On this lab we will see under the hood of cloud advanced analytics services and use a GPU cluster (thanks to Barcelona Supercomputing Center) and we will review the main characteristics of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), one of the most popular frameworks to build AI models.
