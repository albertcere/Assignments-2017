# Lab 5: Under the Hood of Cloud Advanced Analytics Services

Last month Google Cloud Platform launch a public beta allowing users to deploy NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs. [Amazon did the same](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/) some months ago. GPUs can be particularly useful for supporting machine learning workloads through the use of popular machine learning and deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Theano, Torch, MXNet, and Caffe, as well as NVIDIA’s popular CUDA software for building GPU-accelerated applications.

The new Google Cloud GPUs are tightly integrated with Google [Cloud Machine Learning](https://cloud.google.com/ml/) (Cloud ML), which aims to slash the time it takes to train machine learning models at scale using the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) framework.

Cloud ML is a fully-managed service that provides end-to-end training and prediction workflow with cloud computing tools such as Google [Cloud Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/), [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/), [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) and [Google Cloud Datalab](https://cloud.google.com/datalab).

Google is also offering a CloudML Bootcamp to teach new users how to Supercharge performance using GPUs in the cloud More information and documentation are available on the Google Cloud website.
However, it is not just machine learning workflows that can benefit from GPU acceleration. The company also recommends that GPUs can accelerate many workflows including video and image transcoding, seismic analysis, molecular modelling, genomics, computational finance, simulations, high-performance data analysis, computational chemistry, finance, fluid dynamics, and visualisation.
